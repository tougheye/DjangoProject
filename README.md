# DjangoProject


This Django project aims to create a robust system with features for user signup, login, and profile management.
It includes functionalities such as user registration, user data retrieval, updating user details, and deleting user accounts.
The project utilises Django's built-in features for model creation, views implementation, URL routing, and template rendering to achieve seamless user interaction and data management.
Additionally, thorough testing with Postman ensures the reliability and functionality of the CRUD operations.
